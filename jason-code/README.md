**Author**: Jason
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
We want to build a blog site that new content can be previewed and added from the new.html page.

## Getting Started
https://github.com/jlhiskey/05-form-building
In order to add additional content to their blog they need to add content into new.html using the provided form. Once they have completed their data entry the site will auto post their new article.

## Architecture

The application uses Javascript and jQuery and Handlebars to modify the DOM in order to publish blog content to the site. The application uses css to create a responsive site that changes the UX between desktop and mobile views using @media. 

JavaScript, jQuery, handlebars, html, css.

## Change Log

08-19-2018 - Application is partially-functional.
